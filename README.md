#Multifunctional Calculator

Project: This is a Multifunctional Calculator. I have made it in two days with 
the purpose being to test my begginer programming knowledge.
This calculator is nothing serious and it probably has bugs but I will fix
them in the next versions. 

Description: This calculator has a lot of functions the four main ones being:
simple standard calculator, solving arithmethic formulas, solving geometrical formulas and converting units.
Each of the last three functions is divided in more.

1)Arithmethic Calculator:\
.Quadratic Equation\
.Abbreviated Multiplication Formula\
.Fibonacci Sequence\
.Number To A Power\
.Square Root Of A Number

2)Geometry Calculator:\
.Triangle Area/Perimeter/Pythagoras\
.Square/Rectangle Area/Perimeter\
.Trapezoid Area/Perimeter\
.Rhombus/Parallelogram Area/Perimeter\
.Circle/Ellipse Area/Circumference\
.Triangle Angle\
.Triangle Existence Check\
.Pyramid Area/Volume\
.Cube Area/Perimeter/Volume\
.Sphere Area/Volume

3)Conversion Calculator:\
.Temperature\
.Length\
.Mass\
.Energy\
.Speed\
.Time\
.Power\
.Data

Usage: To use the calculator .exe itself simply download the .rar file then go to
MultifunctionalCalculator.rar\MultifunctionalCalculator\bin\Debug and double-click
on the Calculator.exe file.

NB! The .dll files must not be removed, otherwise the Calculator.exe will not
run.

To access the code you will have to open these files in your IDE or Text Editor:\
.main.cpp\
.Menu.h\
.ArithmethicCalc.h\
.FastFormulas.h\
.GeometryCalc.h\
.ConversionCalc.h

Note: Now the code is very easy and I haven't put that much work into it, but
this will change with the next versions. In the future I am planning to make
a better User Interface as well as add more functions, fix bugs, update features,
add new features etc. etc.
